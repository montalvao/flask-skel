# flask-skel
A working Flask skeleton project (to initiate Flask apps)

## How-to

1. Download this skeleton
1. Improve it adding more generic Flask features (extensions, tests, docs, etc)
   * Please consider also sending me a PR :)
1. Look for the words `skel` and `skel-desription` withing the source code and change them as you wish
